# 1. Create a list with at least three numbers on it
a = [69, 420, 123]

# 2. Compare the first and last number in your list and store the resulting boolean in a variable
b = a[0] > a[2] #use the position statement instead of using the actual data.

# 3. Write an if statement that uses your boolean from step 2. If it's true print out a happy message otherwise print out a sad one.
if b:
    print('aaaaaay you got it!')

else:
    print('yo, u dont pass the vibe check')
